# useModalControl for React

## Introduction

Modal windows are an essential part of the UI in modern web applications. Managing them in React can be challenging, especially when trying to prevent multiple windows from appearing simultaneously. The `useModalControl` hook simplifies this task.

## Problem

Developers often face the challenge of controlling the states of multiple modal windows. A lack of centralized management can lead to confusion in the processes of opening and closing windows, which in turn increases the risk of errors and degrades the overall user experience.

## Solution

The `useModalControl` hook provides a practical solution for managing modal windows. This tool gives developers the ability to control the opening and closing of windows through a simple and intuitive API. With `useModalControl`, you can easily prevent multiple windows from opening at the same time, maintaining order and cleanliness in the code.

## How It Works

The `useModalControl` hook uses a single flag in the global store to manage all the modal windows of the application. This eliminates the risk of accidentally opening the wrong window or multiple windows appearing simultaneously. Thanks to strict typing, you will always be aware of which window options are available for use. Additionally, `useModalControl` allows you to pass additional data to the modal window that will be relevant exclusively for the currently open window and will be retained until it is closed. The typing of the transmitted data provides additional confidence and convenience in using the hook.
